About me
I like programming, machine learning, neural networks, NLP, etc. Python is confident, SQL basics, C++ beginner.

I started doing data analysis not so long ago, I attend a course at my university, it was thanks to him that I discovered what I really like to do. Unfortunately, in my experience there are only educational projects so far, so I want to get an internship :)
